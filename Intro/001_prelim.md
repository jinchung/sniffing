# Introduction

# Disclaimer

* I am not:
  * A developer of WireShark: I'm a user like you -- I can only speculate on questions of "why" in WireShark
  * An RFC lawyer: There are many clauses of many RFCs with which I am not familiar
  * Responsible (in the legal sense) for what may happen should you apply anything we discuss during these presentations
  * There are probably copyrights on stuff we talk about; all copyrights are property of their respective owners, I guess...

# Goals
* Working knowledge of important protocols
* Ability to capture and analyze network traces using WireShark
* Anything else?

## Level-Set

* Terminology
 * Wireshark/Tshark
 * pcap
 * Networking
