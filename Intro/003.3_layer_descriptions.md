# Layers
## Layer 4: Transport layer
* Some tasks performed at this layer
  * Process-Level Addressing (ports)
  * Mux/de-mux
  * Segmentation, packaging and reassembly (this is similar to, but  __not__ the same, as Layer 3 fragmentation)
  * Acknowledgments and Retransmission
  * Flow control
* This is where _reliability_ is defined
