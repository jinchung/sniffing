# Layers
## Layer 3: Network layer
* Defines _inter-_ networking
* Some tasks performed at this layer
  * Logical addressing: (most commonly the `IP` address)
  * Routing: sending data between networks: done by _routers_
  * Datagram encapsulation (a.k.a _packets_)
  * Fragmentation & reassembly (PDUs -- packets --  may be larger than can be accomodated by Layer 2)
  * Error handling & diagnostics
* Some people are startled to learn that this is known as an _unreliable_ protocol
