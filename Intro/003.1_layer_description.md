# Layers
## Layers 1 & 2 : Physical & Data Link
* Physical layer: hardware & signalling (also known as _Layer 1_)
* Data Link Layer (DLL) (also known as _Layer 2_)
  * Wireless & LAN technologies live here
  * Simple- (as opposed to inter-) network
  * Comprises tasks:
    * Logical link control (e.g. IEEE 802.2) --  LLC
    * Media access control -- MAC
    * Data framing
    * Addressing
    * Error detection & handling (e.g. CRC)
    * Physical layer standards (e.g. IEEE 802.3)
